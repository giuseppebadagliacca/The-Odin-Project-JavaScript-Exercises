## Summary

### What I learned
* jasmine 'name of file.spec.js' to run test 
* To exclude a value from an array, can use .filter(val => !args.includes(val))
* Pseudocode means filter through the array, and return any value that is NOT (val)


### What could be improved
* Need more practice and understanding of the rest parameter syntax *'...args'* (Exercise removeFromArray)
